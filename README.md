# SmartThings Numerous SmartApp
SmartApp that sends updates to the Numerous API based on data reported by a SmartThings compatible device.

Numerous is an easy and free way to keep track of your energy usage or other sensors that report numerical data monitored through a SmartThings hub.

##Stuff you'll need: 
  1. The Numerous app for iOS or Android. http://numerousapp.com/
  2. A SmartThings hub and compatible sensor you wish to track. http://www.smartthings.com/

This SmartApp currently only works with a power meter. I intend to add more devices in the future.
